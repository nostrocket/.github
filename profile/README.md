## Nostrocket!

There's no such thing as a "Bitcoin company". A Bitcoin company is a branch of the State. That's why companies like Strike, Unchained, and River have compliance departments.

The reformation gave us separation of Church and State, and Bitcoin gives us separation of Money and State. But we don't (yet) have separation of Business and State.

The separation of Business and State is a complex problem. Nostrocket is an experiment in obsoleting legacy company structures by connecting proof of "work" directly to the equity (and cashflow) of a commercial interest using nothing but nostr + bitcoin.
