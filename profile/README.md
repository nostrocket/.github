Bitcoin's **entire** value proposition is that it cannot be controlled by the State. It has **no value** beyond this.

### What companies call "Bitcoin" is **not** Bitcoin. 

If you use Bitcoin as a company, your Bitcoin activity is governed by the State (this is why "Bitcoin" companies like Strike, River, Unchained etc have compliance teams).

Bitcoin is permissionless, it doesn’t need KYC and you can send money to anyone on the planet (even if they're on the OFAC list). 

What companies call "Bitcoin" is permissioned by the State. If you own/run/work for a company and don't believe me, I have friends on the OFAC list and I'd be happy to give you addresses for a few of them so you can prove me wrong by transacting with them.    

The State-permissioned fork that companies call "Bitcoin" is mostly interoperable with genuine Bitcoin right now, but this fork will become more regulated and the regulations will become more strictly enforced as we go deeper into [phase two of Bitcoin's war against the State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_xgmVLyB94).

### The Solution
Separation of Business from State. 

All human organisational structures are fundamentally composed of human action (and *inter*action) because human action is the only primitive by which humanity can influence how the present reality is brought forth from the infinite potential of the future.

The usefulness of a bucket is created by the limitations or restrictions imposed by its base and sides. A bucket is useful because it holds water by creating boundary conditions on what the water cannot do while remaining in the bucket.

Human organisational structures are useful because what they do with humans is analogous to what a bucket does with water. These structures are defined by their boundary conditions on human action - what type of action humans can take while remaining within the organisational structure.

Nostrocket is an experiment in discovering the boundary conditions on sovereign human action that create the conditions for an organisation that creates more value for honest and productive contributors than any other opportunity available to them. We do this by creating a universally applicable hill-climbing algorithm, executed by sovereign human action. This may not be possible, but if not it would be nice to know why so that we can iterate. 

Nostrocket completely abandons the paradigm where companies control and allocate resources. Instead, it creates a first-pass at the boundary conditions required for sovereign individuals to do that instead, refactoring the corporation as a non-custodial coordination layer between multiple individuals allocating their own time/resources towards solving a problem that they all believe is worth solving.

This is a complex problem, but the first step is to connect proof of "work" directly to the equity (and satflow) of a commercial interest in a completely non-custodial way.

[Hypergolic](https://github.com/nostrocket/hypergolic) is a nostr client that implements the Nostrocket protocol. It is buggy and experimental, and under active development.
